## Rebecca Food

Rebecca Food is a personal food store project built in ReactJs. <br/>
React Hooks, Context API and Axios are some of techniques I used to create this web application.<br/>
On the home page, there's a list of restaurants and a form for search.
Each restaurant has a special page where the user can see the menu availaible for tht day.
Depending on the schedule, a restaurant is open or closed (open between 10am and 9pm).<br/>
To satisfy the users preferencies, the site can be visited on light or dark mode by a click on the right corner button.
### Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
