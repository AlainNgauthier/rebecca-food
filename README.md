## Rebecca Food Project

Rebecca Food is a personal project built with ReactJs. React Hooks, Context API and Fetch API are some of techniques used to create this application.
Firstly, to satisfy the users preferencies, the site can be visited on light or dark mode clicking on the right corner button.
On the home page, there is a list of restaurants and a form for search. Depending of the schedule, a restaurant will be open or closed (open between 10am and 9pm).






### Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
